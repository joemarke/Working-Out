# Working-Out
**_Working Out!_** is an application created to maintain a healthy and consistent workout routine, designed for simplicity.

Designed in Sketch and created in SwiftUI over the course of a three day sprint, *Working Out!* was created out of necessity. In the run up to my half marathon, my training had to be focused to allow for a strong performance. Keeping my dynamic workout routine in my head was getting too complex, resulting in me completing the wrong workout or even missing days entirely. I decided to solve this problem the best way I know how; tailor-making an application tending to my needs.

*Working Out!* allows me to log my workouts, and uses an algorithm to decide what my next activity should be. It sends daily local notifications informing me of the day's activity, as well as reminder notification to log the workout if I haven't already. It's simple and pleasant to use, providing all the functionality needed to allow me to maintain a good schedule.
